# Physics_C_pendulum_prj

## Project Description  
Our project is a simulation of a sand pendulum oscillating across the xy plane. As the pendulum is moving it would trace a path. The resulting path is known as a lissjous pattern. The user has the option to control a variety of factors that impact the resulting lissajous pattern.  

## Controls
